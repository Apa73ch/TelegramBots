# ModismBot

Created with [python-Telegram-bot](https://github.com/python-telegram-bot) and Python 3.x 

## Purpose

To make a bot that will track what admins and creators of chats say

Any user will be able to say /modism and the bot will forward a random previous message sent by the mod of the chat, in that chat.

One of the previous commit doesn't use MongoDB, pull that code if you want the bot to use chat_data rather than MongoDB.
