# ModismBot

Created with [python-Telegram-bot](https://github.com/python-telegram-bot) and Python 3.x 

## Purpose

To make a bot that will track what admins and creators of chats say

Any user will be able to say /modism and the bot will forward a random previous message sent by the mod of the chat, in that chat.
